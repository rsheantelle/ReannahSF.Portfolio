    <h3>A little about me</h3>   

    <div class= "row">
        <div class="col-md-10">
            <p>I was born in the Philippines, specifically located in the Province of Ilocos Sur. But, I grew up on the Island Of Oahu, and have lived in Waipahu ever since. As an individual, and as an only child. I grew up with a father that likes to help people either dealing with mechanical, or technical issues/problems. Because I was raised like that, I was taught how to problem solve, learning patience, and empathy. As well as lending a hand to others in need and the satisfaction of making a positive impact on someoneâ€™s life. I went to Honowai Elementary School, then went  over to Waipahu Intermediate School. I am currently an upcoming Senior at Waipahu High School, in the Academy Of Informational Technology. Throughout High School, I have taken multiple courses that deals with the topic of Computer Science.</p>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>I'm planning to study at Portland Community College, and then transfer to Oregon State University. To achieve my degree in Software Engineering, and Criminal Justice. Withholding this degree will help me get my dream career and fulfill my goals of helping others, and being a role model to the younger generations to keep pushing, even when it seems like you feel like giving up. </p>
